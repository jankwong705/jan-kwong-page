## Jan Kwong
### Third Year Computer Science Student @ UCSD

**Hello, everyone! My name is Jan!**

I am currently an undegraduate student at UC San Diego majorng in Computer Science and minoring in Cognitive Science. I have a passion for higher education research and automatic speech recognition (ASR). Currently, I am an Undergraduate Research Assistant at the UCSD LASR Lab, where I participate in a project on forced aligners and neural networks for phonetic recognition. 

In my research assistant role, I read and analyze papers on different ASR models, such as Whisper by Open-AI, and compose code that calculates the word error rate of the recognized speech output. I use Git as a version control tool and collaborate with other researchers and supervisors. I enjoy working with students and researchers who share my interest in learning and innovation. I value diversity, collaboration, and feedback, and I believe that I can bring unique perspectives and experiences to the team.
